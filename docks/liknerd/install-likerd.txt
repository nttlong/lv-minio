# Why we need linkerd
# Challanges with Microservices
# Based on polyglot development
# Highly distributed
# Difficult to debug
# Hard to implement logging and tracing
# Dynamic scale-in and scale-out
# Disparate protocols
# Implements internal and external load balancers

What is a Service Mesh?

Plugs itself into the intra-service communication
Intercepts east-west (even north-south) traffic
Captures telemetry related to services and traffic
Adds an implicit security layer
Enables service discovery
Implements policy-driven routing and traffic management
Interfaces well with legacy and modern infrastructure
